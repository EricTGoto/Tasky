# Tasky

Background:

My first React project. Originally, the project was going to be quite small, but I kept adding to it as I was learning more and more about React and then I decided to make this a bigger project.

Things I learned with this project:

- useState to persist and update values on the screen with the setState function
- useRef to get references of DOM nodes, instead of using document.querySelector or document.getElementbyId
- the difference between useState and useRef
    - changing state will cause re-renders, changing useRef doesn't cause a re-render
- 

Things I used to make this project:

- React
- ESLint, date-fns, gh-pages
- Git, Github
